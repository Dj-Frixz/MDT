# MDT
### Some Turing machines I wrote in my free time

_To run these machines I recommend you use my friends' MDT interpreter (link: https://github.com/luigirinaldi/C_projects/tree/master/MDT_interpreter), it works wonderfully and is hands down the best there is out there. They also might work if copy-pasted to https://https---www.turingsimulator.net/ (text field on the right).
There are different version of every machine grouped in directories, and every one of them has a little explanation at the bottom._
